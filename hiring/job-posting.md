# Software Engineer

### Who we are

Levatas is a collection of smart, creative individuals who shape brands and build technology so that we can help good companies solve hard problems.

We are headquartered in beautiful Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. We are 5 minutes away from the beach, have sunny days all year round, and take advantage of them every time we can.

We have a passion for digital, a devotion to understanding human behavior, and a knack for making beautifully designed customer experiences. We care about the details, we like to have the difficult conversations, and we never settle for seconds. 

We care deeply about having happy clients and being happy ourselves.

### Who you are

You are an engineer. You care about what makes things work, subscribe to too many programming blogs, and think your code is the best in the world. You have an opinion in a Java vs. .NET discussion and are not afraid to defend it.

You are different. We already have enough of the same, so we are looking for you to bring your background, personality, and unique perspective. You get excited about working with people that look and think nothing like you.

You can't wait to start doing what we are not doing. To tell us what we are missing, where we are failing, and how to do things better. We are here to listen, and we want you to be ready to talk.

You come without an expiration date. You are looking for a home, for a place to stay and build a career. We aren’t interested in short term help; in short projects that will end and get you on your way for what’s next. We want to carve a place for you for years to come.

You aren't the best at anything, but you are smart, confident, and eager to challenge and be challenged. We want you to look ahead and be excited about how much is still left for you to learn.

### What do you have to offer

You are an excellent .NET developer that's not afraid of getting deep down with Java. You've read the books, talked the talk and walked the walk. You can comfortably speak about software principles and can teach anyone about what good code means.

You understand the web, RESTFul services, and what's different with HTML5. You have an opinion about the proliferation of JavaScript libraries and have done plenty of CSS before. You can talk about OAuth2, Service Workers, responsive sites, and Single Page Applications. Keep in mind that we do a lot of AngularJS, React, and we want to start doing as much TypeScript as we can.

You are very comfortable working with relational databases and you can tell how they compare to non-relational ones. You have written stored procedures, optimized SQL queries, and know how indices make things faster. Ideally, you have had more than an introduction to NoSQL and know the differences between ETL and ELT, but this is certainly not required.

You get excited about new challenges, but you’d rather see things thru before moving on. Your strong suit is your ability to run the final 20 percent of the way, to get things done. You understand that teams are more important than individuals, and you strive to make those around you look better every day. 

You present and communicate very well. You’ll do a lot of talking, to us and our clients. You feel comfortable defending your points of view, don’t shy from the spotlight, and are always first to grab a marker and doodle away on the closest whiteboard.

### What's like to work at Levatas

We are big on Agile. At any given point in time we have multiple teams attending all of our active projects. Teams are usually up to four or six people, but we have the occasionally large project with a large team behind the scenes.

At Levatas family comes first, and we never ask you to decide between life and work. We want you to be happy and healthy, and mostly banned overtime across the board, so you can say goodbye to the long hours.

Our team have built robots, made CGI videos, created data warehouses, built artificial intelligence and machine learning solutions, played with blockchain, and even created virtual and augmented reality applications. Our playground is right at the edge of technology, so if you are the type of engineer that enjoys breaking things and moving fast, you’ll be right at home.
