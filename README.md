# Engineering handbook

At Levatas, our Engineering team is a fundamental part of the success of our company. For us to understand what's important, to guide the decisions we make every day, and to help us grow and create the future we want to develop, we put together this handbook consisting of the following sections:

* [Our values](values.md)
* [Roles and responsibilities](roles-responsibilities.md)
* [Advancement opportunities](advancement-opportunities.md)
* [Engineering workflow](engineering-workflow.md)

We use these principles and guides to ensure our performance upholds our standards of excellence, and for those that go above and beyond, we keep their names in a special place:

* [Acknowledgements](acknowledgements.md)

Also, [here is a list of resources](resources.md) we want to make sure all our team has access to (and read and watch, of course).

More on the technical side, we also keep the following resources that specify how we approach different problems related to our daily work:

* [Estimating Projects](estimating-projects.md)
* [Website Development and Deployment Checklist](websites-checklist.md)
