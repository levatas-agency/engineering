# Advancement opportunities

From any position you are currently on, you should have plenty of opportunities to grow as a professional. Your direct manager should be able to help you understand where you are and actively work with you on the areas that can help you grow.

Here are several areas that you can focus on to make sure you achieve success:

1. __Increase your technical competence.__ Find ways to increase your value to Levatas by improving your technical skills. From picking up an entirely new language to familiarize yourself with a different section of your project, you should have plenty of room to grow and stretch your abilities. Look at those areas within the technology stack used by Levatas that most interest you and go for them. 

2. __Improve your professional communication.__ Communication is usually overlooked by engineers when growing their careers. However, it's probably the single most important area we all can improve that quickly pays off. From flawless writing skills to understanding how to communicate with non-technical people effectively, there's a lot to cover that will quickly increase your value to Levatas. 

3. __Improve your problem analysis skills.__ We solve problems every day. Large or small, every project needs people to come up with solutions that keep Levatas in the forefront of the industry. Get on the action! Try to improve the way you tackle problems. Ask the reason behind decisions made by other people, and soon you'll be able to contribute your own.

4. __Actively add value and take initiative.__ This is probably the simplest thing you can start doing right away. Don't wait until somebody tells you what to do. Look, and you'll see how every single thing around you is ripe for disruption, from making your project a little bit better to your workspace more enjoyable. 

5. __Become the "go-to person".__ There's hardly anything else that will get you more attention than becoming the "go-to person" for your projects. Start by focusing on an area that's difficult or annoying and become an expert. Never lose sight of the quality of your work, don’t over do it, and be ready to take responsibility when things don’t go your way.
