# Estimating projects
Accurately estimating software development tasks is very hard. Humans are notoriously bad at predicting things they don't 
fully understand, hence the difficulty of properly estimating development work. 

What follows is a list of suggestions that you should incorporate to your estimation sessions. By following them, you will 
greatly improve the quality of your estimates.

## Refining the list of requirements

After you have the list of requirements needed to build the product, spend some time following this list:

* Identify the essential features needed to make the product serve its purpose.
* Identify the least important features for meeting the clientâ€™s goals. These will be candidates to cut if you need to 
adjust the scope of the product.
* Identify features that might be overly expensive (in time or budget) and discuss a possible simple alternative.
* Identify potential internal and external dependencies to finish the product.
* Identify the risks and discuss a plan to mitigate them.
* Identify hidden features that are not explicitly mentioned in the client's request but are necessary to complete the product.

## Making sure you don't forget something

Before the end of the session, make sure you run through these questions and adjust your estimates based on your answers:

* How long will it take you to clarify all the requirements, document them, and prepare the backlog of the project?
* How long will it take to prioritize and size that backlog?
* If you need to put together an initial release plan, are you accounting for the time to do it?
* Are there any third-party integrations that will require further review and you aren't planning on it yet?
* Do you need to schedule any time to think about performance, scalability and the security of the project?
* Are you planning enough time to deploy the product?
* How much time do you need to transition the project to the client?
* Do you need to do any user training before handing over the project?
* Is there any data migration that you should include in your estimate?
* Is there any warranty period that should be planned and estimated?

## What to do if estimates are too high?

More often than not, your estimates might come too high, and you will have to find ways to cut them down. Here are some suggestions to keep in mind:

* Do not simply cut the numbers down without thinking about the consequences.
* For any adjustment you make to the estimates, there should be an assumption written down as part of the requirements.
* A good way to cut down estimates is by looking at the least important features.
* When there are no more features to cut, look at those with the higher estimate and explore ways to reduce the work needed. Make sure you take notes of every assumption you make.
* Always remember that if you torture the data long enough, it will confess to anything. Don't push it.
