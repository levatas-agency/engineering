# Looking at our 2018 hiring process

Hiring the right people goes beyond a great interview. In an industry where companies are fighting over candidates from an every day smaller pool, employers have to differentiate themselves to attract and retain the talent available. 

Whatever worked yesterday, doesn't apply anymore. We have to step up our game to remain competitive and keep growing our world-class team.

This write-up explains where I'd like to take the hiring process for our engineering team in 2018. It will serve my department as a guidance, and hopefully, it will accelerate conversations across the entire company.

There are things here that we can change right away. Other things will need help from the executive team. Rather than trying to be comprenhensive, I'm focusing on new ideas, areas that we can improve, and things that could benefit others at Levatas.

Finally, everything here can use the experience and ideas that every department brings to the table, so let's make this a conversation.

### Where are the people hanging out?

I can tell you where they aren't: in our backyard waiting for our call. 

We have to work very hard to find the people that we want to hire. We can't just expect that they will come to us whenever we open a new position. Recruiters help to find talent, but their motives are different than ours, and the cost is significant. We need a different strategy, a primary one, and then supplement it with job boards and recruiter firms.

Here are a few ways we will start getting closer to the talent we need:

* Convert our Lunch and Learns into after-hour networking events where we can invite people from the community. We can do 8 - 10 of these events every year with minimum planning and low cost.

* Work on our employer brand. Who doesn't want to work for a company with name recognition? We need to start tapping our marketing and social media power. We need people to see Levatas as a force in the industry and a great place to work.

* Great candidates aren't looking for jobs. They aren't looking. To change this, we need to network more. Go to conferences. Local universities are an excellent source of talent. 

* Let's maintain a candidate pool that we can tap in the future. Every interview gives us winners and people that didn't make the cut. Sometimes, these folks are an excelent choice for our future needs, so we should have them on speed dial. Let's create a registry company-wide where we keep candidates that we can reach in the future.
 
### Stop speaking in bullets

We aren't who we say we are, but what we do.

We like to think and speak about our culture, but then every job posting selling our company is written in bullet points, just like every other boring large corporation out there.

People can't connect with a checklist. They want to hear our story and the reason they should drop every other opportunity and come work for us. Just like we appreciate thoughtful letters and resumes, this is our chance to impress.

* Let's dedicate some time and replace our corporate-like job postings with a thoughtful write-up that explains the position we are trying to fill. 

* Let's make sure the questions we ask have meaning to us and aren't just the same questions corporate America has been asking for the last decade.

### We need to talk more about ourselves

It isn't you who is desperately trying to work for me. It's me who wants this to happen.

We need to show off a little bit more. We have created a fantastic culture with excellent benefits. People can't believe what we have when we show them, but we fail to do that consistently — especially when recruiting.

* That job posting that I mentioned above? That's the first time we have a few seconds to impress candidates, so let's use it.

* Revamp our Careers page on our website. We want to tell our story, but we also want to be specific to new candidates looking for an opportunity. We want this space to be all we need people to see to fall in love with us.

### We need multi-dimensional interviews

90 minutes of conversation can't possibly be enough to start a successful long-term relationship.

Levatas is way more than the work we do every day, but we put most emphasis on it when interviewing candidates — and sometimes, that's all we care. False positives are very expensive, so we want to avoid them as much as we can.

* Let your team help when testing for a cultural fit. Organize an hour or two for a few people on your team, so they meet the candidate and ask questions. They — and probably not you — will be working with this person every single day, so you want their approval.

* Your ability to answer questions in a high-pressure situation has very little correlation to your ability to succeed at Levatas. I let people go home with an exercise and come back in a week with their solution. 

* Have more than one person interviewing the candidate. This is the best way to keep your biases in check. The more help you get from others on the team, the better decision you'll make at the end.

Getting people to show up is nothing compared to getting them to stay.

A good onboarding process is a perfect epilogue to a great interview. We have done a lot of work to revamp our onboarding process, but we can't start bragging about it yet. The first few days at a new job set the tone for what's about to come, and we can do more to make people feel they made the right decision:

* Let people pick their preferred equipment. I've never seen anybody trying to get something ridiculous. We have guidelines in place that don't make us better, and more often than not, make us look cheap.

* We need to invest in desks and chairs. We like to refer to ourselves as a world-class team; therefore, we deserve world-class desks and chairs. 

* With every new person joining, we need to take the entire team to lunch. This is a great way to introduce them and have some fun time together away from the office.
